# demo2

Possible improvements:

* `on: issue_comment` trigger that matches only based on prefix
* `actions/checkout` could include a refspec option
* We could have a `github.pull_request_id` context variable / `GITHUB_PULL_REQUEST_ID` environment variable
* `GITHUB_TOKEN` should have `checks:write` access?
